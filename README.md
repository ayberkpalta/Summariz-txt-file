This code is a simple Streamlit web app that allows users to upload a text file and generate a summary using OpenAI's language model (via Langchain). Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. Page Setup and Instructions
The page is titled "AI Text Summarizer".
A message is displayed to inform the user that ChatGPT cannot summarize long texts but this app can do so.
The app prompts the user to enter their OpenAI API key to use the summarization functionality.
2. API Key Input
The user is asked to input their OpenAI API key in a password field to authenticate and interact with OpenAI's models.
3. File Upload
The user can upload a .txt file containing the text they want summarized.
Once the file is uploaded, the content is read as a string for processing.
4. Text Processing and Chunking
If the uploaded text exceeds 20,000 words, the user is prompted to provide a shorter text file. This is to ensure the text fits within the processing limits of the model.
The text is split into smaller chunks of up to 5000 characters using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which allows large documents to be processed in manageable sections.
5. Summarization Chain
The app loads an OpenAI model using the provided API key and uses Langchain's load_summarize_chain to create a summarization chain. The chain uses the "map_reduce" method for summarization.
The chunks of text are passed through the summarization chain, and the output summary is generated.
6. Output
The summary of the uploaded document is displayed to the user.
Key Libraries:
Langchain: Used for chaining together components like prompt templates, language models, and summarization chains.
OpenAI: Provides access to the GPT-based language model.
Streamlit: Used to create the web interface for file uploading and displaying the summary.
Flow:
User uploads a .txt file.
The file is read and split into smaller chunks.
The text is passed to OpenAI's model for summarization.
The generated summary is displayed to the user.
